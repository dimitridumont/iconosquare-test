#  Iconosquare - Test performed by Dimitri Dumont

I made the choice for this test not to use component libraries (antd, material ui, react-boostrap, etc.) in order to be the least dependent on external dependencies and to demonstrate knowledge of integration (flexbox, grid , etc).

The project is architected according to clean architecture (to find out more, I created a [repository](https://github.com/dimitridumont/clean-architecture-front-end) to give my definition of clean architecture in front with an example of a project).
