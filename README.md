I made the choice for this test not to use component libraries (antd, material ui, react-boostrap, etc.) in order to be the least dependent on external dependencies and to demonstrate knowledge of integration (flexbox, grid, responsive, etc).

The project is architected according to clean architecture (to find out more, I created a [repository](https://github.com/dimitridumont/clean-architecture-front-end) to give my definition of clean architecture in front with an example of a project).
